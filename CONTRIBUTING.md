# Contributing to MyPIA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MyPIA (My Personal Intelligent Assistant)! This document outlines our development approach and coding standards to ensure consistency and maintainability across the project.

## Development Approach

1. **Version Control**: We use Git for version control and follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching strategy.

2. **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports, feature requests, and general task tracking.

3. **Pull Requests**: All changes should be made through pull requests. Each PR should be linked to an issue and include a clear description of the changes.

4. **Code Review**: All pull requests require at least one review from a team member before merging.

5. **Continuous Integration**: We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. All tests and linters must pass before a PR can be merged.

6. **Documentation**: Code should be well-documented, and any new features should include updates to the relevant documentation files.

## Coding Standards

We follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code and the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for additional conventions. Here are some key points:

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

2. **Maximum Line Length**: Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code and 72 for comments and docstrings.

3. **Imports**: 
   - Group imports in the following order: standard library imports, related third party imports, local application/library specific imports.
   - Use absolute imports when possible.

4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Functions, variables, and attributes: `lowercase_with_underscores`
   - Classes: `CapitalizedWords`
   - Constants: `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
   - Protected instance attributes: `_single_leading_underscore`
   - Private instance attributes: `__double_leading_underscore`

5. **Comments and Docstrings**:
   - Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
   - Use Google-style docstrings format.

6. **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function arguments and return values.

7. **Error Handling**: Use explicit exception handling. Avoid bare `except` clauses.

8. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new functionality. Aim for high test coverage.
